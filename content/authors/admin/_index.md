üëã Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at [**Radboud University Medical Center**](https://www.radboudumc.nl). I work within the [**Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl), and my research interests revolve around the design and development of AI algorithms in radiology. I currently work with [**Alessa Hering**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/alessa-hering/) in the [**COMFORT**](https://comfort-ai.eu/) project. 

üßëüèΩ‚Äçüéì For my PhD research, I was supervised by [**Colin Jacobs**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/), [**Bram van Ginneken**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/bram-van-ginneken/), and [**Mathias Prokop**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/mathias-prokop/). My thesis is on AI for lung cancer screening, with a focus on early lung cancer detection from chest CT scans. In my first [**publication**](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2021204433), we showed that deep learning algorithms are comparable to clinical experts at predicting lung cancer risk. This story was also covered by the **[Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/18/artificial-intelligence-just-good-picking-lung-cancer-doctors/)**. üòä 

As part of my PhD research, I spent 10% of my time providing support for users of [**grand-challenge.org**](https://grand-challenge.org). I also volunteered as an editor for [**The Gradient**](https://www.thegradient.pub). I was responsible for outreach, and I edited articles to make sure they met the publication standards. 

üõ†Ô∏è Prior to my PhD, I worked at an early-stage startup called Predible (acquired by [**nference**](https://nference.com)) for three years, where we developed deep learning algorithms for wrist x-ray, chest CT, and abdomen CT analysis.

üíô During my free time, I love to play outdoor sports, read books and, occasionally, stargaze.
