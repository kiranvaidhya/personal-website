Kiran is a PhD candidate at [Radboud University Medical Center](https://www.radboudumc.nl). He works within the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG)](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl), and his interests revolve around the use of deep learning algorithms for medical image analysis.

He is supervised by [Colin Jacobs](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/), [Bram van Ginneken](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/bram-van-ginneken/), and [Mathias Prokop](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/mathias-prokop/). His PhD thesis is on AI for lung cancer screening. Under the [lung cancer image analysis group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/research/lung-cancer-image-analysis/) led by Colin, he develops and validates deep learning algorithms for early detection of lung cancer from chest CT images. In his first [**publication**](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2021204433), he showed that deep learning algorithms are comparable to clinical experts at predicting lung cancer risk. This story was also covered by the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/18/artificial-intelligence-just-good-picking-lung-cancer-doctors/).

As part of his work at DIAG, he also spends 10% of his time providing support for users of [grand-challenge.org](https://grand-challenge.org).
