üè•I'm a PhD candidate at a Dutch hospital called Radboudumc. I work within the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG), and my interests revolve around the use of deep learning algorithms for medical image analysis.

üéìI'm supervised by and Colin Jacobs, Bram van Ginneken, and Mathias Prokop. My PhD thesis is on AI for lung cancer screening. Under the lung cancer image analysis group led by Colin, we develop and validate deep learning algorithms for early detection of lung cancer from chest CT images. In my first publication, we showed that deep learning algorithms are comparable to clinical experts at predicting lung cancer risk. This story was also covered by the Telegraph. üòä
