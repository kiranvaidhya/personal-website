The summer of 2020 has been bittersweet. In spite of the continuing ramifications of COVID-19, the night sky managed to put on a show for a lifetime, uniting people under these very stressful times.
Intrigued by what the astrophotography mode could offer in my Pixel 3 XL, I decided to embrace the night sky and explore how I can enthuse the astro-loving kid within me. 
And boy, did I come in for a surprise..

# Comet NEOWISE

Comet NEOWISE has taken the astronomy world by surprise when it suddenly lit up in the night sky as it tumbled towards the Sun in its 6,766 year round-trip.
As the skies cleared up on one July evening in Nijmegen, I decided that that was the night I would stay awake to hunt and capture the comet.
It was around 3:45 in the morning when I spotted the comet with my naked eyes. I was flipping between different sky maps and fervently calibrating the sensors in my phone to spot Capella.
When I did spot Capella, it was just a matter of seconds before I saw the comet hanging in the early dawn sky, like a crown jewel with its unmistakeable tail. 
I lost my breath and bellowed across my window as the adrenaline rushed through my body.
A frantic few minutes followed as I put together a series of contraptions to ensure the comet was within the field of view of my phone.

I wish I had stepped out into the open fields to capture this beauty. The Sun was rising fast and the window of opportunity was closing. I did manage to get a few more shots.

# Andromeda

There is something mystical about the Andromeda galaxy. 
It is moving towards us at a speed of 110km per second and is predicted to collide and merge with our galaxy in ~4.5 billion years, like dancing partners twirling into each other's arms.
Edwin Hubble's observations of Cepheid variables in the Andromeda galaxy also provided substantial evidence towards the fact that the great "nebula" in Andromeda was actually extragalactic in nature, further uncovering a larger, grander and a humbling universe.

Image produced by stacking 10 images of one minute exposures using Sequator. It's amazing what Google's astrophotography mode can capture these days.
Kudos to the Google AI team for producing a modern day marvel. A few decades ago, it must have been hard to imagine that pocket phones could capture the structures of Andromeda today.
